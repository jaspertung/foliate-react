        light: `Bright indirect light. Never allow your plant to stand in the direct sunlight--the leaves will burn. It can survive in medium light but avoid a dark corner`,
        water: `Maintain a regular watering schedule and keep the soil of your plant moist, but not wet or saturated. This is not a drought-tolerant plant, but it is relatively forgiving if you forget to water it from time to time. Extended periods of dryness can result in brown leaf tips or edges. Root rot will occur if the soil is allowed to become soggy.`,
        humidity: `Alocasias love extra humidity. Mist your plant on a regular basis, place a humidifier nearby, or use a pebble tray to increase humidity. Your bathroom or kitchen are perfect spots for your Alocasia because these areas tend to be more humid.`,
        food: `For best results, use a general houseplant fertilizer every four weeks during the spring and summer. No fertilizer is necessary during the winter months when plant growth naturally slows. Only apply fertilizer to damp soilâ€“never dry, as it can burn the roots.`,
        toxicity: `Alocasias are mildly toxic to pets and humans. Typically, ingestion will cause mouth and stomach irritation and possible vomiting.`
